Dear Editor,

Contemporary art music is typically considered “poison for the box office”, in Hong Kong at least. I would like to argue that it is merely because there is insufficient exposure thereto, and the music is not particularly poisonous to concert turnover.

Teeming with dissonance, extended performance techniques, and incomprehensible musical languages, contemporary art music is clearly not appreciated by the public, even among concertgoers. One can envision a vox pops interview with randomly selected people in downtown Causeway Bay, where the vast majority of the interviewees could name classical composers like Mozart but none of the 20th century ones like Messiaen or Schoenberg. Likewise, they would most likely find the music written by the former superior to that by the latter.

On planet Earth, our ears are well-trained to interpret and appreciate the kind of music that we are most familiar with. For example, we grow up listening to nursery rhymes, spend our youth banging our heads to metal, woo our loved ones with pop ballads, and jeer at old people who still listen to traditional music. Whichever way, we are tuned and tempered to such musical languages that shape our aesthetics for music.

Now, consider an alien planet (let’s call it Penderecki) where each and every alien bonny babe grew up listening to the likes of (well) Penderecki, and maybe some Alban Berg and Iannis Xenakis as well. That is, they are drowned in a musical culture that corresponds to our modern art music. With that aesthetic, when they arrive on Earth, they would find the works of Billie Eilish and Beethoven presumably rather repugnant: consonance is for the weak-minded, regular orchestras are impaired by design, and their musical languages are thoroughly incomprehensible. In short, the aliens of Penderecki would be likewise deeply ingrained in their accustomed aesthetic, and any attempt to bring Haydn there would result in a catastrophe for the box office.

With that unnecessarily long-winded argument about exposures shaping preferences out of the way, one may think I am going to talk about music education and promotion for our new music, but no, such thoughts are dead wrong.

I do not seek to argue that bombarding everyone with contemporary art music one way or another can improve its perception, because it is largely impractical. While it is not difficult to introduce it to our schools’ music classes, it is what happens outside the classrooms that matters. As it stands, the world is still very much tonal and continues to delight in its expressions, and plausibly one cannot raise a child sufficiently deprived of its influence. Similarly, it would be not economical to invest in bringing the varied styles of modern art music to every household.

Nonetheless, it must be noted that individual artists like Jacob Collier have managed to somewhat bridge the gap between avant-garde and popular music; that is perhaps where all composers should aspire to be. For disclosure, I do not enjoy contemporary art music in particular, but I also have nothing against it. Heck, if I were a serious composer, I would prefer to go down that route, because there is very little left to be imagined in the tonal style akin to that of the Common Practice Period. Still, I am inclined to assume that in the future, a new “common practice” would emerge, and the world would frolic in its music at large, so that box offices would not have the slightest chance to slack off when it came to art music concerts.


Yours faithfully,
