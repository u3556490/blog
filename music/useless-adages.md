## On harmony

### Fundamental theorem of harmony?

> A scale can be harmonised using a set of chords whose chord tones union to give the set of notes of the scale, or a superset thereof.

Without getting into definitions, this holds true as an axiom (thus less of a theorem). Consider this: The 7 notes of the C major scale are fully covered by the chord tones of the scale's I, IV and V chords. Taking the union of `{C, E, G}`, `{F, A, C}` and `{G, B, D}` gives you the scale `{C, D, E, F, G, A, B}`. Of course this is not the only solution, I, ii7 and V7 form another valid combination; as well as bVII (`{Ab, C, Eb}`), iii (`{E, G, B}`) and vii07 (`{B, D, F, A}`) - they union to give `{C, D, Eb, E, F, G, Ab, A, B}` which is a superset of C major. The art is obviously in the choice of when to use which chord.

### Another fundamental theorem of harmony?

> With extensions considered, any note can be harmonised by any chord.

I feel like this has been stated by YouTuber Wiki Kuan before, without the clause at the front, but I can't find the video.

This can be considered an abuse of musical notation. But given a note and a triad, if the note does not equal any member of the triad it can be reconsidered as a 7th (major or minor), 9th (major or minor - one may transpose the root note down by an octave to force a second into a ninth), 11th (perfect or augmented), or 13th (major or minor). Thus an Eb on top of a C major can be seen as a minor 13th.

Needless to say this has limited utility, except when you want to refute someone's accusation that you just used a free [[non-chord]] tone. Also very importantly, unlike the previous adage / observation, this rule may not necessarily hold true for a note defined *outside* of the temperament, because there may not be a name for such harmonisation (what, minor 13th and 23 cents flat?).
