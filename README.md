# Blog

I don't want to maintain a blog website, and it happens that I am a casual Git(Hub) user. So here we are, blog but git.

These are sometimes just formatted notes of my readings, which I made when I had nothing better to do at work, or other stuff I want to write and post online. May contain more opinions or malformed facts than good stuff, read with caution.

## Contents

Currently we have:

- [Yet another monad tutorial](./yet_another_monad_tutorial/monads%20(1st%20half)%20-%20functors%20and%20applicatives.md)
- [Text(s) about music](./music/)
  - [A love letter to contemporary art music](./music/letter-to-contemporary-art-music.md)
